                     <p>I am an adventurous and hardworking man and a perfectionist when it comes to work. It must be orderly and clean to be considered good.
                     My work experience is quite varied from being a painter, landscaper, food service manager to the finishing of parts for spinal surgery.
                     I always try my best at everything i do by seeing my jobs as a game. My goal is to not only finish the task at hand but to do it better
                     than most. I believe strongly of the concept of measure twice cut once, for even experianced individuals make mistakes. So to maintain a 
                     good standard I have my own quality control of my work. Often I check my work so far to make sure I have a solid foundation to keep building
                     on.

                     </p>

                     <p>I enjoy outdoor activities in my free time such as hiking and camping. My favorite places to go are in the mountains and canyons. The feeling
                         and sense of accomplishment with the reward of a beautiful perspective makes all the effort to get there that much more satisfying.
                     </p>
                    
                     <p>I hope to find a career in programming so I can provide for my family. I think the fact that it is a constantly changing field will make it a 
                       exciting and rewarding career choice.

                     </p>
